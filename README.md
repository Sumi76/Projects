1.1	 Objective of the study:
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the cost of digital media campaigns for a food mart in the USA on the basis of 60K customers income, product, promotion and store features. 
To Explore the important factors that affect the cost on media campaigns



1.2	Need of the Study:
In recent times, the share of media in the market budget is increasing year by year, from 6.4% to 9.5% in 2021. However, media advertising is an integral part of the marketing budget, so data analysis is the best solution to keep the spending within a reasonable range. There are more than 40 characteristics of 60K customers, such as income, number of children in the household, education level, food type, store area, etc. the media type is based on daily paper, radio and TV. The lack of robust predictive model hampers our ability to optimize budget allocation efficiently. By providing cost estimates it would be useful to allocate resources effectively and maximize the return of investment (ROI) for the media campaigns


1.3	Business or Enterprise under study:
Food Mart (CFM) is a chain of convenience stores in the United States. The private company's headquarters are located in Mentor, Ohio, and there are currently approximately 325 stores located in the US. Convenient Food Mart operates on the franchise system.
              

1.4	Data Sources:
              The dataset used in this project is obtained from kaggle
